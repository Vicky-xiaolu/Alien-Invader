# Alien-Invader-
- This Python project involves designing and programming game animation and collision application.
- This is an alien invader game that is inspired by the classic Space Invader with added features, such as BarrierWalls, Changing speeds of aliens, and multiple waves of aliens.
- The primary controller class of this game extends GameApp and implements three main methods (start, update, and draw) for processing the player inputs and starting/running a game.
- The sub-controller creates a wave of alien and has a reference to the ship, aliens, and any laser bolts on-screen. It animates the laser bolts and removes any aliens. It also marches the aliens back and forth across the screen until they are all destroyed or they reach the defense line.
